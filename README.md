# Student Performance Prediction Project

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting student academic performance using machine learning techniques. It addresses Sustainable Development Goal 4 (Quality Education) by helping identify students who might be at risk of underperforming academically, enabling early intervention and targeted support.

## 🎯 SDG Problem Addressed
- **SDG 4: Quality Education**
  - Promotes inclusive and equitable quality education
  - Supports lifelong learning opportunities for all
  - Aims to identify at-risk students early
  - Enables data-driven educational interventions
  - Helps optimize resource allocation

## 🤖 Machine Learning Approach
- **Model Type**: Simple Linear Regression
- **Dataset**: Student Performance dataset from Kaggle
- **Predictor Variable**: Reading score
- **Target Variable**: Math score
- **Train-Test Split**: 80-20
- **Evaluation Metrics**: R² and Mean Squared Error (MSE)

## 📈 Results
- **R² Score**: 0.73 (73% of math score variation explained by reading scores)
- **Model Coefficient (Slope)**: 0.83
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: 72.74
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: ~8.5 points

## ⚖️ Ethical Considerations
- Avoid reinforcing existing biases based on socioeconomic or demographic factors
- Do not use predictions in isolation for high-stakes decisions
- Maintain data privacy and fairness
- Ensure transparency in model implementation
- Consider underrepresented groups and students with learning differences
